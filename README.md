**Smart screen accurate user vision protective application**

*The problem*

As a smart screen user, who spends long hours using smart devices affects my vision, especially over a
long time. I could have blurry vision, eaisly lose concentration, increased eye strain and have swhenpleep distortion.
I am not comfortable wearing eyeglasses to have to deal with blue rays at these times, also for my
children who are 10 years and below who use smart devices alot. I don't want their
reading habits to be distorted by long exposure to smart screen.
I am unable to manually select what screen display protects my vision by accurately displaying text fonts, color temperature , and screen brightness at different moments.

*How does Smart vision care help?*

Smart vision care is an inbuilt software application that conducts eye tests and uses eye sensors to monitor users' eye
coordination and displays screen accordingly, from the eye test results and monitoring users' eye coordination.
Screen display is accurate, therefore, user does not need any manual settings that may not accurately protect his(her) vision. 
Inspite of how much time I spend using the smart screen, I am not afraid of vision problems , even when 
without wearing eyeglasses.

Perfect for my children!

*Who's Smart vision care for?*

As a smart screen user, you don't need to bother wearing eyeglasses each time you want to use your smart screen, Smart vision care protects your vision 💯.
Little children, who are 10years and below benefit exceedingly because 'book mode' can be selected. Therefore,
using smart devices over a long time does not make the pages of a book unfriendly to them.
