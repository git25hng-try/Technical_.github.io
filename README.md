**Smart screen accurate user vision protective application**

***The problem***

As a smart screen user, who spends long hours using smart devices, blue light rays affects my vision, especially over a
long time. I could have blurry vision, eaisly lose concentration, increased eye strain and have sleep distortion.

In addition, I am unable to accurately select font sizes or color temperature that protects my vision at different moments and reduces eye strain.

Consequently, I am not comfortable wearing protective ray eyeglasses always or most of the time to deal with blue rays at these times, also for my 10-year old children and below who use smart devices a lot. I don't want their
reading habits to be distorted from long exposure to smart scree

***How does Smart vision care help?***

Smart vision care is an inbuilt software application that conducts eye tests and uses eye sensors to monitor users' eye
coordination and displays screen accordingly, from the eye test results and monitoring users' eye coordination.
Screen display is accurate, therefore, user does not need any manual settings that may not accurately protect his(her) vision. 

Inspite of how much time I spend using the smart screen, I am not afraid of vision problems , even
without wearing blue ray protective eyeglasses.

Perfect for my children!

***Who's Smart vision care for?***

As a smart screen user, you don't need to bother wearing eyeglasses each time you want to use your smart screen, Smart vision care protects your vision 💯.

Highly recommended for little children, who are 10years old and below because 'book mode' can be selected. Therefore,
using smart devices over a long time does not make the pages of a book unfriendly to them.
